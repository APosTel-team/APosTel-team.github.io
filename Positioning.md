# Positioning

Traditionally, positioning is based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA) method, using hyperbolic triangulation. *Code reference coming soon!*

A new approach is to start from time of arrival and include the information of an animal behaviour model. This approach is used in the [YAPS algorithm](https://github.com/baktoft/yaps), presented in Baktoft, Gjelland, Økland & Thygesen (2017): [Positioning of aquatic animals based on time-of-arrival and random walk models using YAPS (Yet Another Positioning Solver)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14278-z.pdf).
